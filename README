shrep is just a platformer i (zlayd) made because i was bored

required libraries (linux):
	libsdl2-2.0-0
	libsdl2-dev (for compiling)
	libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0
	libsdl2-mixer-dev (for compiling)

you'll get errors if you don't have these

to compile shrep just run the "compile_shrep.sh" file (obviously),
then run the shrep binary that was compiled
if yer on linux anyway (also, you'll need gcc)

if ya run windows i don't know what to tell you,
i'm not very familiar with it,
maybe run shrep in cygwin or a virtual machine or somethin'

controls:
	a/left arrow - move left
	d/right arrow - move right
	space - jump
	return/ctrl/mouse1 - shoot
	c/mouse2 - throw 'os

edit mode only controls:
	w/up arrow - move up

ya can contact me (zlayd) at xavier.allegretta@outlook.com,

sorry
